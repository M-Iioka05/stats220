## Finding correlations between different variables and how full the AT bus rides get 

![](https://tvnz-1-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/J6IFKHZ5PRBQHNCPVBKCRW73YI.jpg?auth=a987636f01c208e8141f1b6ac7c3eda0214b0ea4755fd901f1570df70b8a0cb6&quality=70&width=1024&height=576&focal=983%2C489)

*In* order to determine correlations with how full a bus get's with other variables such as the bus stop location and whether or not the bus is on time. I have collected my data by logging observations from my daily bus rides for a week, taking note in a Google form. 


### How late was the bus?

                         temperature = 4,
                         fullness = 5,
                         arrival_status = 6,
                         late_time = 7,
                         Location = 8)

# late_time
mean_late <- mean(latest_data$late_time) %>%
             round(1) %>%
             paste("minutes", collapse = "")

mean_seconds <- mean(latest_data$late_time*60) %>%
                round(1) %>%
                paste("seconds", collapse = "")


rides <- length(latest_data$late_time) %>%
               paste("bus rides")

maximum_late <- max(latest_data$late_time) %>%
                paste("minutes")

ggplot(data = latest_data) +
       geom_bar(aes(x = late_time,
                fill = "#FFCBDD")) +
  
       labs(title = "Length of time bus was late by in minutes",
                x = "How long was the bus late by in minutes",
                y = "Number of bus rides",
          caption = "Source: Google Form")

```
Out of `r rides` the mean time the bus was late by was `r mean_late` or `r mean_seconds`. In addition to this the latest bus to arrive during this week was by `r maximum_late`.

### How full was the bus?

I measured  how full the bus was by using a scale of 0 to 5, 0 being empty and 5 being completely full. This week the maximum level of fullness was `r maximum_full`, and the minimum fullness of the bus was `r minimum_full` the average fullness of the bus was `r mean_full`.
