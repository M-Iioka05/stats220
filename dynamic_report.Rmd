## Finding correlations between different variables and
## how full the AT bus rides get

 *In* order to determine correlations with how full a bus get's with other variables such                                    
as the bus stop location and whether or not the bus is on time. I have collected my data by                                  
logging observations from my daily bus rides for a week, taking note in a Google form. 



### How late was the bus?
```{r fig.width = 5, fig.height = 3}
# importing Google sheet csv
logged_data <- read_csv("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSNM70cFcVXSqYjOnjR-HwFwnz8n7jHtWWdDEhV6brKNtPiR8GI4Rn4yHFyf1FvX6_PLr8sFhPJg6fY/pub?gid=1147511225&single=true&output=csv")

latest_data <- logged_data %>%
                  rename(week_day = 2,
                         time = 3,
                         temperature = 4,
                         fullness = 5,
                         arrival_status = 6,
                         late_time = 7,
                         Location = 8)

# late_time
mean_late <- mean(latest_data$late_time) %>%
             round(1) %>%
             paste("minutes", collapse = "")

mean_seconds <- mean(latest_data$late_time*60) %>%
                round(1) %>%
                paste("seconds", collapse = "")


rides <- length(latest_data$late_time) %>%
               paste("bus rides")

maximum_late <- max(latest_data$late_time) %>%
                paste("minutes")

ggplot(data = latest_data) +
       geom_bar(aes(x = late_time,
                    fill = "#FFCBDD")) +
  
       labs(title = "Length of time bus was late by in minutes",
                x = "How long was the bus late by in minutes",
                y = "Number of bus rides",
          caption = "Source: Google Form")

```
 
  Out of `r rides` the mean time the bus was late by was `r mean_late` or `r mean_seconds`.                                In addition to this the latest bus to arrive during this week was by `r maximum_late`.

### How full was the bus?
```{r fig.width = 5, fig.height = 3}
# importing Google sheet csv
logged_data <- read_csv("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSNM70cFcVXSqYjOnjR-HwFwnz8n7jHtWWdDEhV6brKNtPiR8GI4Rn4yHFyf1FvX6_PLr8sFhPJg6fY/pub?gid=1147511225&single=true&output=csv")

latest_data <- logged_data %>%
                  rename(week_day = 2,
                         time = 3,
                         temperature = 4,
                         fullness = 5,
                         arrival_status = 6,
                         late_time = 7,
                         Location = 8)

# fullness
mean_full <-  mean(latest_data$fullness) %>%
              round(1)
minimum_full <- min(latest_data$fullness)
maximum_full <- max(latest_data$fullness)

# bar chart
ggplot(data = latest_data) +
       geom_bar(aes(x = fullness)) +
                
       labs(title = "Fullness of bus",
                x = "Bus fullness",
                y = "Number of bus rides",
          caption = "Source: Google Form")
```

   I measured  how full the bus was by using a scale of 0 to 5, 0 being empty and 5 being completely                    
full. This week the maximum level of fullness was `r maximum_full`, and the minimum fullness of the                       bus was `r minimum_full` the average fullness of the bus was `r mean_full`.    

```{r fig.width = 5, fig.height = 3}

logged_data <- read_csv("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSNM70cFcVXSqYjOnjR-HwFwnz8n7jHtWWdDEhV6brKNtPiR8GI4Rn4yHFyf1FvX6_PLr8sFhPJg6fY/pub?gid=1147511225&single=true&output=csv")

latest_data <- logged_data %>%
                  rename(week_day = 2,
                         time = 3,
                         temperature = 4,
                         fullness = 5,
                         arrival_status = 6,
                         late_time = 7,
                         Location = 8)
