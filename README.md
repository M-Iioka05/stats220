### stats220 - My repo for STATS 220  
A little about me: 

* I am in my second year of University, double majoring in *Psychology* and *Statistics*  
* I am taking STATS 220 because I am interested in the programming side of statistics  
* I am interested in learning about how to `code`

Through the GiF website [Tenor](https://tenor.com) two meme's I found that captures how I feel about university is:
